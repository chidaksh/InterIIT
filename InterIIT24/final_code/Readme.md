# AI Agent 007: Tooling up for Success

## Overview

This is our repository which contains the implementations of our proposed solution for the problem statement.
Each folder contains a detailed `README.md` file, which consists of instructions on how to run the code.

1. <b>Chain of Thougts</b>: Explores a series of questions through a structured approach, providing insightful answers to each query.

2. <b>DFSDT</b>: Decision Forests for Sequential Decision Making, is a machine learning approach that uses decision forests (groups of decision trees) to handle tasks requiring step-by-step decisions. It helps predict outcomes in intricate situations by modeling sequential decision processes effectively.

3. <b>Inference-ToolLLM</b>: This suggests a Tool-Use Framework which enhances the tool-use capacity of existing open source LLM.

4. <b>ToolQA+GPT</b>: This is a one prompt engineering technique where we obtain outputs by feeding a prompt to gpt-3.5-turbo model.

5. <b>ToolQA+ReAct</b>: Thought, Action and Observation prompting technique to aid solving problems involving critical thinking and logic involved.
